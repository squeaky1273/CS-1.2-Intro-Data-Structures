Really really ridiculously good-looking
Stop trying to make fetch happen
Freakin’ idiot
Whatever I feel like I wanna do 
Gosh
Dang it
Greater good
I am your wife 
I'm the greatest good you're ever gonna get
We get the warhead and we hold the world ransom for
One million dollars
Leave the gun
Take the cannoli
Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer
It's not a man purse
It's called a satchel
Indiana Jones wears one
You’ll shoot your eye out, kid
Who ya gonna call
Don’t cross the streams
Human sacrifice! Dogs and cats living together 
Mass Hysteria
Keep the change, ya filthy animal
You’re killin’ me, Smalls
For-e-ver
Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries
Yeah, but I shoot with this hand
I love rumors Facts can be so misleading, whereas rumors, true or false, are often revealing
